# Testbed Instances
Our test script `test.py` uses the same testbed of instances for the labeling algorithm as Froger et al. (2019), where the algorithm was developed. 
The instances, routes, and solutions can be downloaded from the author's website [here](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~afroger001/) ([direct data download link](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~afroger001/documents/data-Improved_formulations_and_algorithmic_components.zip)).
